# Online-Database
This program is intended to run a questionnaire that takes users inputs and stores them in an online database for easier manipulation, access and, use of the data.

  
  The idea for my project stems from a yearly event that I volunteer at during the holiday season. The event is called “Santa’s Caravan” and its purpose is to supply and deliver Christmas presents of families who are unable to provide the Christmas experience for their children. There is an interview process where the parents fill out information about their family and their children (see attached photos), in order to determine what gifts would best suit their children. All of the data from these interviews are not kept digitally, but on paper. Every year we provide Christmas to around 65 families with, on average, 3 children per family. For that many individuals to have such detailed data being manually kept in one binder really bogs down the entire system and is an inefficient and highly ineffective way to store information. Changing this paper cataloging to an online data base with all the information from the interview form on it will allow for easier manipulation, access and, use of the data.
  
  My idea to change this current paper system is to create a database for data from the interview form be input in like in our DB in Python example. I would create a simple website in flask that would ask for the interview inputs to but saved in the database. The website would make it so the process would not be too technical and would be simple enough for the average user just entering data to understand. A lot of the families in the area we service are Spanish speaking families, so it would first ask what language the client would like for their ease of use, before going into the more specific questioning. The family’s information will be grouped on the database so that all of their information could be populated on an excel template to give to the shoppers for gift purchasing. After all of the data is inputted to the database, we will be able to pull specifics from the data set for further processing, like addresses to create delivery routes or family size to put together food boxes for the families. 
  
  This software is for the volunteers interviewing people for Santa’s Caravan. Typically, these are not the most tech savvy individuals, so the interface will have to not be incredibly complicated. I imagine this as a website that prompts inputs of specified data that would be so simple, anyone who can type can use it. The website would only serve as the input device, and there would be separate commands access the data for manipulation. We could use the DB Browser for SQLite to see the data or have commands to populate this data into an excel file. The lists will be exceptionally useful to just be able to immediately pull up all relevant information about a family to make changes or gather useful information in order to supply their perfect Christmas.
